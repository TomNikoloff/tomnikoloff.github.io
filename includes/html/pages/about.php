                                I've always had a passion for technology and computers. Originating from a love of PC gaming at a young age. After starting to learn web development during lockdown and using my free time to progress my skills. It had only served to solidify what role I wanted to fulfil. So at the beginning of 2022, I took the plunge and made it my goal to become a developer fulltime. By early May of that year, I landed my first job as a Web developer and haven't looked back since.

                                I am a reliable, conscientious and hardworking individual, who is equally confident working as part of a team and on my own initiative. I feel that I would bring enthusiasm and commitment to any job that arises. I like tackling a problem head on and and working towards a solution.

                                When I'm not at my computer, I'm am usually in the gym, hanging out with family or going for long walks with my golden retriever, Lola.
