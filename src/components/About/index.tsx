                                            My fascination with technology and computers traces back to my early days, sparked by a love for 
                                            PC gaming. During the lockdown, I ventured into learning web development, dedicating my free time to honing my 
                                            skills. This pursuit cemented my ambition â€“ I was determined to pursue a career in this field. In early 2022, 
                                            I took the leap, setting my sights on becoming a full-time developer. By April of that year, I secured my first 
                                            role as a junior developer, marking a pivotal moment that has propelled me forward ever since.

                                            thriving both in collaborative team environments and when driving projects independently.
                                            My approach involves infusing enthusiasm and unwavering commitment into every task at hand. 
                                            I'm drawn to challenges, proactively tackling them head-on, fueled by the drive to unearth effective solutions.
